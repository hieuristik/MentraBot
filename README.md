# MentraBot
MentraBot is an AI-assisted Discord Bot with the primary goal of helping students study more effectively.
  
The Proof of Concept (PoC) will focus on implementing a minimal yet functional version of the bot that performs one core task reliably:  
*"Summarize pasted lecture notes or uploaded study content into short, digestible explanations."*
  
**This initial version will include:**
- A basic Discord command (/summarize) that accepts text input
- An OpenAI-powered backend that returns a concise summary of the content
- Simple error handling and user feedback
- Lightweight deployment (e.g., on Replit, Render, or a local server)
  
**The goal is to validate:**
- Feasibility of AI integration in a Discord bot
- Usefulness of summarization for study support
- A clean, scalable foundation for future features (Q&A, flashcards, quiz generation, document parsing, etc.)
